Description
I have created a store front application using a MySQL database, which is needed to run the page.  The user responds to prompts to decide which item, and how many of said item they would like to purchase.  If the item is in stock the user's order is fulfilled, the price is displayed, and the database is updated.  Otherwise the user is prompted to make a choice.  This application requires the mySQL and inquirer nodes to be installed in order to function and must be connected to a MySQL database.
